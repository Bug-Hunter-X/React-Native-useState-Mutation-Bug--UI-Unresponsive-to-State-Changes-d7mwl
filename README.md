# React Native useState Mutation Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: the failure to update the UI when directly mutating an object or array within the useState hook.  The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation, where a state object is directly mutated. This leads to the UI not reflecting the changes in the state. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the correct approach, using functional updates to ensure the UI re-renders appropriately. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`).
4. Observe the button's lack of effect in the initial file and its corrected behavior in the solution file.

## Solution

The solution involves using functional updates to modify the state correctly.  Instead of directly manipulating the state object, create a new object or array with the desired changes and pass it to the `setMyState` function.  This ensures that React can detect the change and triggers a UI re-render.
